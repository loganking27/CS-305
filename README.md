Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial, a financial institution, aims to enhance the security of its current application with additional measures.
  
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  I found value in conducting static testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in my code. Prioritizing secure coding is crucial for safeguarding not only your own assets but also those of your users. The loss of personal information and trade secrets can inflict significant harm on individuals and businesses alike. Developing secure software is essential for protecting sensitive information and ultimately safeguarding a company's   reputation over time.
  
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The dependency check tool proved to be highly beneficial, significantly streamlining the detection of vulnerabilities compared to manual inspection of each dependency for weaknesses.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  Upon conducting tests, it became evident that many vulnerabilities stemmed from outdated libraries. Updating the current libraries used in the code contributes to the development of more secure software. Implementing penetration testing in the future will enhance our ability to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities within the code.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  I used stack overflow quite a bit and checked how peers were solving situations similar to mine, especially when running into errors in the console.
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
My use of a hash function to send encrypted communications.
